    <h1>To my Pookie Hana üíå</h1>
    <p>
Hyemi,

Now that I think about it, I‚Äôve really known you for such a long, long time. It‚Äôs kinda crazy to realize, because even now, it still feels like I‚Äôm constantly getting to know you more, like there‚Äôs always some new side of you I discover and love.

I remember how I used to miss you so much whenever you‚Äôd be away for days. I never really said anything back then, just quietly waited and hoped you‚Äôd come back online. And every time you did, it felt so exciting, like everything was lighting up.

All those hours we spent playing Aram games, the way you always trolled in game, the midlock punching meta you were doing, the Overwatch games we spammed back then, and so many other things we used to do, I always felt so locked in when I was with you. Like time didn‚Äôt matter. I just wanted to keep going, because being around you made everything more fun and alive.

I‚Äôve always wanted good things for you, even when we were just friends, I was always cheering you on from the sidelines. I liked you for a long time, Hyemi. But I never expected that one day we‚Äôd actually be dating. I was okay just being close to you, because honestly, even just being your friend meant the world to me. You‚Äôre someone I‚Äôve always looked up to, someone who inspires me just by being who you are.

So you choosing to return my feelings, that you gave me your love and trust, it means more to me than I could ever really say. I‚Äôll never take that for granted. You make me the happiest boy alive, and I mean that.

Life used to feel so hollow and empty, like I was just going through the days. But now, you give me something to wake up for. You give everything color.

I know you were looking forward to us going to the festival together to celebrate our 100 days in Japan. Please don‚Äôt feel bad about it, we have so many days ahead of us. We can celebrate our 200 days, 300 days, a million days if you want. I honestly celebrate every day with you. I‚Äôll always be by your side, no matter what. You just focus on resting and getting better. I wish I could send you a Lifeline drone or drop a warming stone!

This is just the beginning of our story. There‚Äôs still so much left to explore, so many things to talk about, games to play, and adventures to go on together.

I love you, my favorite SongSong. ‚ô•Ô∏è
